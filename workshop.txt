description=- Item Tweaker API
description=- Actual Sawnoff Shotguns (Marked as a requirement as otherwise the shotguns look ridiculous)

description=I had issues getting the Item Tweaker API to play nice while making this, so let me know if this doesn't work correctly and I'll take a closer look.
description=Additionally, this should HOPEFULLY work on servers (lua code is stored as shared) but if it doesn't let me know also.

description=Other feedback appreciated.
